# COOJA SIMULATION

The project was simulated via _Cooja_ and _Node-RED_.

The _Cooja_ simulation was made using 5 sky motes, three of them connected to _Node-RED_ via Server sockets. Only two of the 5 motes had a valid API key in the _IFTTT_ Web Request node in _Node-RED_.

---

## Configuration

The motes at the start of the simulation were configurated as follow:

<div align="center">

    />
</div>



## Simulation

The mote 1 was moved around all the others motes, following the path 2 ⇒ 3 ⇒ 4 ⇒ 5 ⇒ 2 ⇒ starting position.

## Results

The result of this iteration is present in the [log.txt](Simulation/log.txt) file.

### Extra

If a mote is connected to a mobile phone via _IFTTT_ services, the user will receive the following notification:
